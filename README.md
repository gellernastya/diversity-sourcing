This repository is a toolkit of ready-to-use Boolean strings to help you with diversity sourcing. 

**It has three sections:**

- [Name search](https://github.com/gellernastya/diversity-sourcing/blob/main/female-names-by-country.md) - a list of the most popular female names per country.
- [Community search](https://github.com/gellernastya/diversity-sourcing/blob/main/communities.md) - a list of the most popular diversity in tech groups and communities.
- [Hashtag search](https://github.com/gellernastya/diversity-sourcing/blob/main/hashtag-search.md) - a list of hashtags most commonly used in posts dedicated to diversity topics.

These lists were mostly created with the help of ChatGPT. 

### How to use it

Each page has a boolean string that can be copy-pasted with one click.

Just click a “Copy” button on the right of the field, paste it in the search bar, and adjust per your needs (add specific location/role/tech/other keywords). 

Examples:  

```jsx
site:linkedin.com/in ("front end" OR javascript OR JS OR React) (developer OR engineer) amsterdam (Emma OR Olivia OR Ava OR Isabella OR Sophia OR Charlotte OR Mia OR Amelia OR Harper OR Evelyn OR Abigail OR Emily OR Elizabeth OR Avery OR Sofia OR Ella OR Madison OR Scarlett OR Victoria OR Aria)
```

```jsx
site:github.com "block or report" javascript (Emma OR Olivia OR Ava OR Isabella OR Sophia OR Charlotte OR Mia OR Amelia OR Harper OR Evelyn OR Abigail OR Emily OR Elizabeth OR Avery OR Sofia OR Ella OR Madison OR Scarlett OR Victoria OR Aria)
```

```jsx
site:linkedin.com/in (javascript OR JS OR "Front End" OR React) netherlands ("Women in Technology (WIT)" OR "Women Techmakers" OR "Code First Girls" OR "Geek Girl Meetup" OR "Women Who Code" OR "Tech Ladies" OR "Ladies of Code" OR "Lesbians Who Tech" OR "QueerJS" OR "She Codes" OR "Women Who Startup" OR "Techettes")
```
