# diversity-sourcing
## Before starting the search

1. Make sure that the **job description** is inclusive:
    1. No gender-coded words or requirements (”guys/gals”, “he/she”, “rockstars/ninjas/etc (besides, no one likes it :D )
    2. No racial bias (”native speaker of..”, “citizen of..”)
    3. No age bias (”young”, “seasoned”. etc)
    4. No elitism (”Ivy League colleges”)
    5. Only necessary requirements (as one often-cited Hewlett Packard study showed, men apply for a job when they meet only 60% of the outlined qualifications, but women don’t feel confident to apply unless they meet 100%).
2. Check that your Hiring Manager has a consistent, structured process and measurable requirements. Encourage them to come up with detailed interview plan to make sure everyone has equal conditions of interviewing.
3. Advise on the panel of interviewers - try to involve underrepresented groups in interviewing. 
4. Be cautious of bias (for yourself and the hiring team) -share the educational materials and have discussion around this if you see the bias having place.  Escalate it with your manager if there is no positive change after those steps.

## Passive channels

1. **Post on specified platforms.** Big list available here:
    
    [https://breezy.hr/blog/top-20-job-boards-diversity-hiring](https://breezy.hr/blog/top-20-job-boards-diversity-hiring). 
    
    Some examples:

### Play around with Boolean

**Core article:** [https://booleanblackbelt.com/2012/12/diversity-sourcing-boolean-search-strings-for-linkedin/](https://booleanblackbelt.com/2012/12/diversity-sourcing-boolean-search-strings-for-linkedin/)  (you will find there boolean strings for examples below) 

Question #1 of sourcing: **what will you expect to see on the page?** That is exactly what should be in your Boolean request.

1. **Search by pronouns:** “she/her”, “they/them”, or analogies in local language of search location (i.e. hen/hun en die/diens in Dutch)
2. **Search by hastags:** #LesbiansWhoTech, #LatinxInTech, #TranstechSocialEnterprises
3. **Name and sorority search.** For instance, I won’t write on my page a word “woman” (although that would be what you are after in your search), but there definitely will be my name which is well, not a male one :) So you can utilise it: 

**Search by names**

## Custom Search Engines by Irina Shamayeva

Custom Search Engine (CSE) is a way to create your own “Google” search that is pre-set for the biggest part of your request (like filetype:, site:, other things), so you only have to put in the key string, like: (backend OR Go OR Golang) AND (engineer OR developer), and the results will be tailored per the rest of it. These CSEs below are tailored for diversity sourcing:
